# BRSR-Report-Generation

### Overview
This project aims to automate the generation of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reports (BRSR) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and data extraction techniques. It currently includes functionalities to extract relevant information from PDF and Excel files and uses this data to draft sections of the BRSR.

However, the project is not yet complete. Key areas for future development include:
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Expanding the data extraction capabilities to cover all relevant data points required for a full BRSR.
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Implementing more sophisticated techniques for cleaning, transforming, and structuring the extracted data.
- **Full BRSR Section Generation**: Developing prompt templates and logic to generate all sections of the BRSR, adhering to the required format and content.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Improving the handling of missing data and potentially querying the LLM for intelligent imputation where appropriate.
- **Validation and Refinement**: Implementing mechanisms to validate the generated report sections and allow for human review and refinement.
- **Integration with UI**: Developing a user interface (potentially using Gradio, as suggested by the imports) to make the tool more accessible.
- **Error Handling**: Enhancing error handling and providing more informative feedback to the user.
- **Configuration**: Allowing users to configure API keys, file paths, and other settings more easily.
